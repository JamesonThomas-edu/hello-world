# hello-world
This repository is for learning how to use Github

This is an addition! About myself:
I am a 3rd year undergrad university student studying Computer Engineering. I am a barista, I love coffee, space, learning how things work, and art! I think these things can all work together to make something great. I hope to one day open up a makerspace.
